  * The project goal is to create a workout tracker using Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express for given files in `Public` folder.

I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
